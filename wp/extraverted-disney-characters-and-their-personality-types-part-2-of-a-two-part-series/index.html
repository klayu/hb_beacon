<p>Why do we love Disney characters so much? What is it about their stories that touches our hearts?</p>
<p>We see reflections of own personalities in characters like Jiminy Cricket, Alice in Wonderland, Pocahontas, and even Merlin. If you know your Myers-Briggs personality type, maybe you can relate to some of them. This blog tells you about the extraverts (E) among Disney’s colorful animated characters</p>
<p><img src="/buzzlightyearENTJ.jpg" alt="buzzlightyear ENTJ">
<strong>ENTJ: Buzz Lightyear</strong></p>
<p>Buzz Lightyear, a toy space ranger in “Toy Story,” is known for his bravery and courage. ENTJ Buzz believes in following the rules. Though a great leader, he’s sometimes impulsive and demanding. He’s a skilled warrior in hand-to-hand combat and stays in peak physical condition. In “Toy Story 2,” Buzz leads a toy gang to rescue Woody, who has been captured by a greedy toy collector.</p>
<p>ENTJs are extraverted (E), intuitive (N), thinking (T), and judging (J). In real life, ENTJs are born leaders. Confident and outgoing, they have a need to run things.</p>

<p>
To them, life is full of people who can transform their visions into realities. To the ENTJ, the world is a treasure trove of possibilities, all of them within reach. 
<br><br>
They can be hard on people who fail to live up to their standards.

<p><img src="/merlinENFJ.jpg" alt="merlin ENFJ"></p>
<p><strong>ENFJ: Merlin</strong></p>
<p>ENFJ Merlin, the wizard of Disney’s animated film “The Sword and the Stone,” is so wise that he can see into the future. He can enchant objects and people. As Merlin travels through time, he learns much about the past, present and future. His wisdom, with its depth and complexity, sometimes leaves others confused. Despite his brains, he can be absent-minded and clumsy.</p>
<p>ENFJs are extraverted (E), intuitive (N), feeling (F), and judging (J). They have a sixth sense for people’s needs and get pleasure from helping them. They make others want to join them to make things happen. ENFJs are quick to show their appreciation to others and are generally well liked. Because they’re so enthusiastic and skilled verbally, they’re often encouraged to take leadership positions.</p>
<p><img src="/RobinhoodENTP.jpg" alt="Robinhood ENTP"></p>
<p><strong>ENTP: Robin Hood</strong></p>
<p>In the animated Disney film “Robin Hood,” the characters are all animals. Robin, cast as a fox, is an ENTP. He heads a band of outlaws who help the poor people of Nottingham. The village has been reduced to poverty by evil Prince John’s unfair taxation. With the help of his band, Robin Hood disguises himself as a beggar and steals Prince John’s loot to give back to the villagers. After many hair-raising adventures, he is reunited with his childhood sweetheart Maid Marian and they go off to live happily ever after.</p>
<p>ENTPs are extraverted (E), intuitive (N), thinking (T), and perceiving (P). Robin Hood is a true ENTP, called the “Explorer” type. ENTPs are always involved in activities that make themselves and others happy. They jump from one challenge to another, often getting more enthusiastic about thinking up new projects than finishing old ones. Their ability to see the big picture is what motivates their creativity. No matter where they are, they have ideas about how things can be improved. Sometimes they seem almost clairvoyant.</p>
<p><img src="/ArielENFP.jpg" alt="Ariel_ENFP"></p>
<p><strong>ENFP: Ariel</strong></p>
<p>ENFP Ariel, Disney’s main character in “The Little Mermaid,” is a strong, determined girl who lives in an underwater kingdom. The 16-year-old mermaid spends most of her time outside the palace walls singing, daydreaming, and sharing adventures with her best friends, a guppy and a crab. She falls in love with Prince Eric, a human, but she has to suffer many trials and tribulations before her father, King Triton, transforms her into human form so she can live happily ever after with her true love.</p>
<p>ENFPs are extraverted (E), intuitive (N), feeling (F), and perceiving (P). They are gracious and tolerant types, able to identify with the thoughts and feelings of others. Adventurous ENFPs are always open to new experiences. They get special pleasure from traveling to distant places. It gives them the chance to meet interesting people in other cultures. With their congenial, open personalities, they sometimes go too far with their enthusiasm and suffer through periods of confusion. They need a friend to help pull them through.</p>
<p><img src="/DodgerESTP.jpg" alt="Dodger ESTP"></p>
<p><strong>ESTP: Dodger</strong></p>
<p>ESTP Dodger, from the Disney movie “Oliver and Company,” is a street-smart Jack Russell Terrier. Appointed as the leader of Fagin’s dog gang of thieves, Dodger is witty, confident, good-hearted and cool. The little dog is clever and crafty and always knows how to get out of scrapes. As Oliver’s best friend, he says he doesn’t eat cats because of “too much fur.”</p>
<p>ESTPs are extraverted (E), sensing (S), thinking (T), and perceiving (P). ESTPs are quick-thinking and action-oriented. As outgoing, lively, and entertaining types, they can be found wherever the action is. They’re at their best dealing with situations that call for a no-nonsense approach. They’re direct with their comments, mincing no words. They also aren’t afraid of taking risks. They’re willing to play for high stakes in the hope of reward.</p>
<p><img src="/SnowWhiteESFJ.jpg" alt="snowwhite esfj">
<strong>ESFJ: Snow White</strong></p>
<p>The main character in Disney’s animated movie “Snow White and the Seven Dwarves” is a beautiful young princess living with an evil stepmother. Snow White, an ESFJ, is so innocent that she can see no evil in the world. This makes her a target for her jealous stepmother, who plots to kill her with a poisoned apple. Only the kiss of a handsome prince is able to wake her from a “sleeping death.”</p>
<p>ESFJs are extraverted (E), sensing (S), feeling (F), and judging (J). Snow White shows the nurturing side of the ESFJ personality as she looks after the Seven Dwarves in their forest home. At their best, ESFJs are good at taking care of others and meeting their needs.</p>

<p><img src="/TimonESFP.jpg" alt="timon esfp"></p>
<p><strong>ESFP: Timon</strong></p>
<p>Timon is the carefree meerkat in “The Lion Kingdom.” An ESFP with a fun-loving attitude, he spends lazy days with his best friend Pumbaa. When Simba the lion cub comes along, they welcome him. Later, when Simba decides to challenge his evil Uncle Scar, Timon shows what friendship means and helps rescue Simba. Timon is a good friend.</p>
<p>ESFPs are extraverted (E), sensing (S), feeling (F), and perceiving (P). They are outgoing, fun-loving types drawn to the company of others. Because of their positive attitude, they’re usually well liked. They’re helpful and are generous with their resources. In fact, they’d rather give than receive. They feel self-conscious when praised too much or singled out for favorable attention. ESFPs notice everything, picking up subtleties that escape others. Downturns in luck shouldn’t be taken too seriously, they believe.</p>
<p><img src="/WoodyESTJ.jpg" alt="Woody ESTJ">
<strong>ESTJ: Woody</strong></p>
<p>In Disney’s animated film “Toy Story,” Woody is a vintage cowboy doll, the favorite toy of a boy named Andy. An ESTJ, Woody is a determined character who tries to keep others on his side. Still, he has a lot of doubt and sadness. He hides feelings from friends so he’ll seem brave, but he’s not afraid to confront them sometimes.</p>
<p>ESTJs are extraverted (E), sensing (S), thinking (T), and judging (J). They are natural organizers. They’re dependable, practical and develop action plans based on logic and experience. Then they roll up their sleeves to pitch in. They keep track of progress to make sure everything is done right. ESTJs are at their best solving concrete problems. Abstract thinking is difficult for them. From their point of view, it’s often pointless.</p>
